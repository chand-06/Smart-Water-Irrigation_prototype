# Smart-Water-Irrigation_prototype

This is an arduino based prototype. The idea behind this project  is prevention  of water wastage, reduction in power consumption and efficient use of solar energy. It is arduino based project using soil moisture, humidity, motor sensors. Demonstration  includes initiating lcd and testing of  moisture content in soil sample ; followed by  required water supply( as decided with help of sensor) and then after the soil being irrigated to requisite level and then switching off the pump automatically.
